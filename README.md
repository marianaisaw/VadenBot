Integrating VAPI Voice AI to build a call-in assistant that scrapes insurance websites in real time, helping patients navigate health plans and understand coverage through natural voice conversations.

I dislike medical bureaucracy, so I wanted to simplify communication with the help of a digital agent with the same knowledge as an insurance provider employee.

Built for my Medical Device Innovation class at Stanford.
